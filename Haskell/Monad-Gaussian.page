title: Monad-Gaussian
...

We have learned that nondeterministic computation is described as List Monad in Haskell. How about continuous probabilistic distributions? Is it possible to describe them as Monads? To make so, we need to add type constraints on the content type of the monad, so we will follow the way Eric have made [made Data.Set a monad](http://www.randomhacks.net/articles/2007/03/15/data-set-monad-haskell-macros).

> {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances, MultiParamTypeClasses,  NoImplicitPrelude, RebindableSyntax, UndecidableInstances  #-}
> import Prelude hiding (return, fail, (>>=), Monad(..))

Let's start with some limitation; we restrict ourselves to Gaussian distributions and assume that the standard deviations are small compared to the scales we deal with.

> data Gaussian a = G {mean :: a, devi :: a} deriving (Eq, Show)

Then, we introduce the monad ''split in half'',

> class Monad1 m a where
>   return :: a -> m a
>   fail :: String -> m a
>
> class (Monad1 m a, Monad1 m b) =>
>       Monad2 m a b where
>   (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b

and make our `Gaussian` their instances.

> instance (Num a) => Monad1 Gaussian a where
>   return a = G a 0

If we could write the following analytically;

$(G~\mu_0~\sigma_0~~\mathrm{>>=}~~f) = \mathit{let}~(G~\mu_1~d_1=f~\mu_0)~\mathit{in}~G~\mu_1~(\sigma_1+\frac{\partial \mu_1}{\partial \mu_0}\sigma_0)$

The Gaussian would indeed satisfy the three monad laws. At the moment, I'll use crude numerical differentiation for approximation;

> instance (Monad1 Gaussian a, Monad1 Gaussian b, Fractional a, Num a, Num b) => Monad2 Gaussian a b where
>   (>>=) (G m0 d0) f =
>      let (G m1   d1) = f m0
>          (G m15  _) = f (m0 + 0.5*d0)
>          (G m05  _) = f (m0 - 0.5*d0)
>          in G m1 (d1 + abs(m15-m05))

Now we can create some value with Gaussian distributions;

> myHeight, myWeight :: Gaussian Double
> myHeight = G 1.90 0.02
> myWeight = G 85 5 

You can even use `do` syntax, thanks to the flexibility provided with
`-XRebindableSyntax`. see [Section 7.3.12.](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/syntax-extns.html#rebindable-syntax) of the GHC users guide.

>   w <- myWeight
>   h <- myHeight
